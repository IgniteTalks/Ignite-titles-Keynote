Ignite-titles-Keynote
=====================

An Apple Keynote file which you can use as 'opening credits' for your Ignite session - see an example at https://vimeo.com/76304898

Install the fonts if required, then edit the names.

Make a recording of the Keynote presentation (eg using Quicktime) then add music in a video editor.

This was based on an idea by Jason Dooley (jasonbyhand.com)
